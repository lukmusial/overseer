# Overseer - High-Frequency Trading Client

> **Educational Project** — This project was built for learning purposes to understand the industry patterns and technologies used in high-throughput trading systems. It explores low-latency architecture, exchange connectivity, trading strategy design, and real-time risk management. **It is not intended for production trading.**

### Dashboard — Momentum and VWAP strategies running against Binance testnet BTCUSDT

### Order History — Full order log with filtering by strategy, exchange, and symbol

## What Is This?

Overseer is a modular trading client written in Java with a React dashboard. It connects to real exchange APIs (Alpaca for stocks, Binance for crypto) and provides a hands-on environment to learn about:

- How trading systems are architected for speed and reliability
- How orders flow from strategy signal to exchange execution
- How positions, P&L, and risk are tracked in real time
- How persistence works without garbage collection overhead
- How algorithmic trading strategies generate buy/sell decisions

The system supports **paper trading** (Alpaca) and **testnet** (Binance) modes, so you can experiment safely without risking real money.

## Key Features

### Live Dashboard

A real-time web dashboard that updates via WebSocket, giving you visibility into everything the system is doing.

- **Engine controls** — Start and stop the trading engine
- **Exchange connectivity** — Connect to Alpaca (stocks) or Binance (crypto), switch between sandbox and live modes
- **Strategy management** — Create, start, stop, and inspect trading strategies
- **Interactive charts** — Candlestick price charts with strategy threshold overlays, powered by Lightweight Charts
- **Position monitoring** — See current holdings, average entry prices, and unrealized P&L
- **Order tracking** — Watch orders flow through their lifecycle in real time
- **Risk limits** — View and configure risk parameters

### Trading Strategies

Four built-in strategies demonstrate different approaches to algorithmic trading:

| Strategy | Approach | What It Teaches |
|----------|----------|-----------------|
| **Momentum** | Follows price trends using moving average crossovers (short MA vs long MA). Buys when short-term momentum exceeds a threshold, sells when it reverses. | Trend-following, signal generation, EMA calculations |
| **Mean Reversion** | Trades the assumption that prices return to their historical average. Buys when price drops below 2 standard deviations, sells when it rises above. | Statistical trading, Z-scores, Bollinger Band concepts |
| **VWAP** | Executes a large order by distributing it across the day proportionally to historical volume patterns, minimizing market impact. | Execution algorithms, volume profiling, participation rates |
| **TWAP** | Splits a large order into equal time slices and executes them at regular intervals over a set duration. | Time-sliced execution, catch-up logic, order scheduling |

### Risk Management

A pluggable risk engine evaluates every order before it reaches the exchange:

- **Max order size** and **max order notional** — Prevents oversized individual orders
- **Max position size** — Limits exposure to any single instrument
- **Max net/gross exposure** — Controls overall portfolio risk
- **Daily order and notional limits** — Caps daily trading activity
- **Daily loss limit** — Stops trading when losses exceed a threshold
- **Circuit breaker** — Automatically halts trading after repeated risk violations, with cooldown recovery

### Exchange Connectivity

Connect to real exchanges with automatic credential verification:

- **Alpaca** — US stocks via REST and WebSocket APIs. Supports paper trading (sandbox) for risk-free experimentation.
- **Binance** — Cryptocurrency pairs via REST and WebSocket APIs. Supports testnet for safe testing.
- **Stub mode** — A fully simulated in-process exchange for offline development and testing.

Mode switching is done at runtime from the dashboard. Credentials are verified with actual API calls before reporting a connected status.

### Persistence

All system state survives application restarts using Chronicle Queue, an off-heap, memory-mapped persistence library designed for low-latency systems:

- **Orders** — Full order lifecycle preserved and replayed on startup
- **Trades** — Complete trade history with fill details
- **Positions** — Latest position snapshots restored automatically, so you pick up where you left off
- **Strategies** — Strategy definitions and parameters restored, algorithm instances recreated
- **Audit log** — Every engine event, risk check, and state change recorded for review

## Architecture Highlights

This project demonstrates several patterns commonly found in professional trading systems:

| Pattern | Implementation | Why It Matters |
|---------|---------------|----------------|
| **Hexagonal Architecture** | Domain core has zero external dependencies; exchanges are pluggable adapters | Keeps business logic isolated and testable |
| **Event-Driven Processing** | LMAX Disruptor ring buffer (64K events) with pipelined handlers | Lock-free, single-writer pattern for predictable latency |
| **Object Pooling** | Reusable Order objects via `ObjectPool<T>` | Reduces GC pressure in hot paths |
| **Zero-GC Persistence** | Chronicle Queue with memory-mapped files and Wire serialization | Writes to disk without allocating heap objects |
| **Integer Arithmetic** | All prices stored as `long` with configurable scale (100 for stocks, 100M for crypto) | Eliminates floating-point errors in financial calculations |
| **Primitive Collections** | Agrona collections instead of JDK wrappers | Avoids boxing overhead for high-throughput data |

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Java 21** — `brew install openjdk@21`
- **Node.js 18+** — For the React frontend

### Build and Run

```bash
# Build everything (backend + frontend)
./gradlew build

# Start the application
./scripts/run-app.sh --full

# Open the dashboard
open http://localhost:8080
```

### Run Tests

```bash
# Backend tests
./gradlew test

# Frontend tests
cd hft-ui && npm test
```

### Development Mode

For frontend development with hot reload:

```bash
# Terminal 1: Start the backend
./scripts/run-app.sh

# Terminal 2: Start the frontend dev server
cd hft-ui && npm run dev
# Opens at http://localhost:3000 with proxy to backend
```
