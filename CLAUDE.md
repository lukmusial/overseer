# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview
A modular high-frequency trading client in Java supporting:
- **Stocks**: Alpaca (REST/WebSocket API, paper trading)
- **Crypto**: Binance (REST/WebSocket API, testnet)

## Java Setup (Required: Java 25 + Java 21)

This project compiles and runs against **Java 25** via Gradle toolchains. Gradle itself runs on **Java 21** (required for Kotlin DSL compatibility).

Both JDKs must be installed. `gradle.properties` configures:
- `org.gradle.java.home` — points to JDK 21 (runs Gradle)
- `javaVersion=25` — the toolchain auto-detects JDK 25 for compilation/testing

### Installing (if not present)
```bash
# Homebrew (recommended)
brew install openjdk@21 openjdk

# Verify both are installed
/usr/libexec/java_home -V 2>&1 | grep -E "21|25"
```

### Switching between Intel/Apple Silicon
Edit `gradle.properties` and update `org.gradle.java.home` to the JDK 21 path for your architecture:
- **Intel Mac**: `/usr/local/Cellar/openjdk@21/21.0.10/libexec/openjdk.jdk/Contents/Home`
- **Apple Silicon**: `/opt/homebrew/opt/openjdk@21/libexec/openjdk.jdk/Contents/Home`

## Development Workflow (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

**Every functional change MUST follow this workflow:**

1. **Implement the change**
2. **Write tests** - NEW FUNCTIONALITY MUST HAVE TESTS (see Testing Requirements below)
3. **Run tests** - `./gradlew test` and `npm test` (for UI changes) must pass
4. **Verify application startup** - `./gradlew :hft-app:bootRun` must start successfully
5. **Update documentation** - if the change affects architecture, update `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`
6. **Commit to git** - atomic commits with meaningful messages

Never skip tests, application startup verification, documentation updates, or commits. This ensures:
- Code is always in a working state
- Application can actually start and run (not just compile)
- Changes are tracked and reversible
- Regressions are caught immediately
- Documentation stays in sync with code

### Test Failure Policy (ZERO TOLERANCE)

**Every test failure MUST be investigated.** Never dismiss a failure as "pre-existing" or "unrelated to my change":

1. **Investigate first** — read the assertion message, check the test code, understand what broke
2. **Rerun to check for flakiness** — if a test fails, rerun it (`--rerun-tasks`). If it's intermittent, it's a flaky test that needs fixing (e.g., race condition, missing `Thread.sleep`/`awaitility`, async assertion timing)
3. **Fix or report** — either fix the failure or clearly flag it to the user with the root cause analysis. Do not silently move on
4. **No green-washing** — do not claim "all tests pass" when some were skipped or ignored. Report the exact count: "78/81 passed, 2 flaky, 1 unrelated to this change (here's why: ...)"
5. **Flaky tests are bugs** — a test that sometimes passes and sometimes fails indicates a real problem (usually a race condition). Treat it as a defect worth investigating, not noise to dismiss

### Commit Policy

**Always commit at the end of completing a plan (or plan phase), as long as tests pass.** Do not wait for the user to ask — committing is the final step of every completed unit of work. If a plan has multiple independent phases, commit after each phase completes successfully. Leaving working, tested changes uncommitted is never acceptable.

```bash
# Standard workflow for backend changes
./gradlew test
./scripts/run-app.sh &
sleep 15 && curl -s http://localhost:8080/api/engine/status && pkill -f HftApplication
git add -A && git commit -m "Description of change"

# Standard workflow for frontend changes
cd hft-ui && npm test && cd ..
./scripts/run-app.sh --frontend   # Rebuild UI assets
git add -A && git commit -m "Description of change"

# Full stack changes (verify both backend and frontend)
./gradlew test && cd hft-ui && npm test && cd ..
./scripts/run-app.sh --full &
sleep 15 && curl -s http://localhost:8080/api/engine/status && pkill -f HftApplication
git add -A && git commit -m "Description of change"
```

### Starting the Application

Use `scripts/run-app.sh` to start the app. It automatically kills any prior running instance.

```bash
./scripts/run-app.sh              # Backend only (skip frontend build)
./scripts/run-app.sh --full       # Rebuild frontend + start app
./scripts/run-app.sh --frontend   # Rebuild frontend assets only (no app start)
```

**IMPORTANT: Frontend changes require a rebuild.** If you modify any files under `hft-ui/src/`,
the frontend must be rebuilt before the running application will serve the updated UI. Either:
- Use `./scripts/run-app.sh --full` to rebuild and restart in one step
- Or run `./scripts/run-app.sh --frontend` to rebuild assets, then restart the app
- Using `-PskipFrontend` or the bare `./scripts/run-app.sh` will NOT pick up UI changes

### Testing Requirements (MANDATORY)

**All new functionality MUST include corresponding tests.** This is non-negotiable.

#### Backend (Java) Testing

For new/modified code, add tests to the appropriate module's `src/test/java` directory:

| Module | Test Location | Test Type |
|--------|--------------|-----------|
| `hft-core` | `hft-core/src/test/java/com/hft/core/` | Unit tests for domain models |
| `hft-algo` | `hft-algo/src/test/java/com/hft/algo/` | Unit tests for algorithms |
| `hft-api` | `hft-api/src/test/java/com/hft/api/` | Controller tests (MockMvc), Service tests |
| `hft-exchange-*` | `hft-exchange-*/src/test/java/` | Integration tests for exchange adapters |
| `hft-bdd` | `hft-bdd/src/test/resources/features/` | End-to-end BDD scenarios |

**Backend test patterns:**
- Controllers: Use `@WebMvcTest` with `MockMvc` for REST endpoint testing
- Services: Use `@ExtendWith(MockitoExtension.class)` for unit tests
- Integration: Use `@SpringBootTest` for full context tests

```bash
# Run all backend tests
./gradlew test

# Run specific module tests
./gradlew :hft-api:test
./gradlew :hft-algo:test
```

#### Frontend (React/TypeScript) Testing

The UI uses Vitest + React Testing Library. Tests are located alongside components:

| Type | Location | Pattern |
|------|----------|---------|
| Hook tests | `src/hooks/*.test.ts` | Test custom hooks in isolation |
| Component tests | `src/components/*.test.tsx` | Test component behavior and rendering |

**Frontend test patterns:**
- Use `vi.mock()` to mock dependencies (hooks, API calls)
- Use `render()`, `screen`, `fireEvent`, `waitFor` from testing-library
- Test user interactions, not implementation details

```bash
# Run frontend tests
cd hft-ui && npm test

# Run with coverage
cd hft-ui && npm run test:coverage

# Watch mode for development
cd hft-ui && npm run test:watch
```

#### What MUST Be Tested

| Change Type | Required Tests |
|-------------|----------------|
| New REST endpoint | Controller test with MockMvc |
| New service method | Service unit test |
| New React component | Component render + interaction tests |
| New custom hook | Hook unit test |
| New algorithm | Unit tests + BDD scenario |
| Bug fix | Regression test proving fix |

### Documentation Requirements

**Update `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` when:**
- Adding or removing modules
- Changing component interactions or data flow
- Adding new trading algorithms or strategies
- Modifying risk rules or circuit breaker behavior
- Changing persistence mechanisms
- Altering the event processing pipeline
- Adding new sequence flows (e.g., new order types)

**Documentation uses Mermaid diagrams** - ensure diagrams are updated to reflect changes:
- Architecture diagrams for structural changes
- Sequence diagrams for flow changes
- Class diagrams for new interfaces/implementations
- State diagrams for state machine changes

## Quick Start

```bash
# Build the project (includes frontend build automatically)
./gradlew build

# Run tests
./gradlew test

# Run BDD tests
./gradlew :hft-bdd:test

# Run JMH benchmarks
./gradlew :hft-bdd:jmh

# Start the application (kills prior instance, skips frontend build)
./scripts/run-app.sh

# Start with frontend rebuild (use after UI changes)
./scripts/run-app.sh --full

# Rebuild frontend assets only
./scripts/run-app.sh --frontend
```

### Frontend Build Automation

The frontend (hft-ui) is automatically built and bundled when running:
- `./gradlew build`
- `./gradlew :hft-app:bootRun` (without `-PskipFrontend`)
- `./gradlew :hft-app:bootJar`

This is handled by Gradle tasks:
- `npmInstall` - Installs npm dependencies
- `buildFrontend` - Runs `npm run build` (TypeScript compile + Vite bundle)
- `copyFrontend` - Copies dist to `hft-app/src/main/resources/static`

**When using `./scripts/run-app.sh` (default, no flags) or `-PskipFrontend`, the frontend is NOT rebuilt.**
If you have pending UI changes, use `./scripts/run-app.sh --full` or `./scripts/run-app.sh --frontend`.

For frontend-only development with hot reload:
```bash
cd hft-ui && npm run dev
# Runs at http://localhost:3000 with proxy to backend at :8080
```

## Architecture (Hexagonal/Ports & Adapters)

The system follows hexagonal architecture:
- **Domain Core** (`hft-core`): Business logic and models
- **Ports** (`hft-core/port`): Interfaces for external dependencies
- **Adapters** (`hft-exchange-*`): Exchange implementations
- **Persistence** (`hft-persistence`): Chronicle Queue stores for orders, trades, positions, strategies, and audit events
- **API** (`hft-api`): REST/WebSocket API, exchange connectivity with credential verification, strategy lifecycle
- **UI** (`hft-ui`): React dashboard with real-time WebSocket updates and interactive charts

### Startup Restoration
On startup, `TradingService.init()` restores persisted state in order:
1. Positions (from `ChroniclePositionSnapshotStore` — non-flat positions only)
2. Orders (from `ChronicleOrderRepository`)
3. Strategies (from `ChronicleStrategyRepository` — recreates algorithm instances)

### Exchange Connectivity
`ExchangeService` manages connections with runtime mode switching (stub/sandbox/live). Credentials are verified via API calls (`/v2/account` for Alpaca, `/api/v3/account` for Binance) before reporting authenticated status. WebSocket connections and MarketDataPorts are only established after successful verification.

## Key Design Principles

### Low-Latency Patterns
1. **Object Pooling**: Use `ObjectPool<T>` for frequently created objects
2. **Primitive Collections**: Use Agrona collections instead of JDK
3. **Off-heap Memory**: Chronicle for persistence
4. **Lock-free Messaging**: LMAX Disruptor ring buffer
5. **GC Tuning**: ZGC with `-XX:+UseZGC` (generational is default since Java 24)

### Core Domain Models
- `Order`: Mutable for pooling, tracks full lifecycle and latency metrics
- `Position`: Tracks quantities, average price, realized/unrealized P&L
- `Quote`: Market data with bid/ask prices and sizes
- `Trade`: Executed fill with commission tracking
- `Symbol`: Immutable identifier for trading instruments

### Metrics System
- `OrderMetrics`: Comprehensive order statistics (counts, latencies, throughput)
- `LatencyHistogram`: Lock-free histogram with percentile support
- All metrics are thread-safe using atomic operations

## Code Conventions

### Prices and Quantities
- All prices stored as `long` in minor units (cents for USD)
- Use `priceScale` field (default 100) for conversions
- Example: `$150.00` stored as `15000L`

### Timestamps
- All timestamps in nanoseconds (epoch nanos)
- Use `System.nanoTime()` for latency measurements
- Use epoch millis for exchange timestamps

### Object Pooling Pattern
```java
ObjectPool<Order> orderPool = new ObjectPool<>(Order::new, 1024);
Order order = orderPool.acquire();
try {
    // Use order
} finally {
    orderPool.release(order);
}
```

## Testing

### Backend Unit Tests
Located in `src/test/java` of each module. Run with:
```bash
./gradlew :hft-core:test
./gradlew :hft-api:test
./gradlew test  # All modules
```

### Frontend Unit Tests (Vitest)
Located in `hft-ui/src/**/*.test.{ts,tsx}`. Run with:
```bash
cd hft-ui && npm test
cd hft-ui && npm run test:coverage
```

### BDD Tests (Cucumber)
Feature files in `hft-bdd/src/test/resources/features/`
Step definitions in `hft-bdd/src/test/java/com/hft/bdd/steps/`

Key scenarios:
- Order lifecycle management
- Position tracking and persistence across restarts
- Strategy creation and restoration
- Performance metrics validation

### Performance Benchmarks (JMH)
Benchmarks in `hft-bdd/src/test/java/com/hft/bdd/benchmark/`

Key benchmarks:
- `OrderBenchmark`: Order creation and lifecycle
- `MetricsBenchmark`: Metrics recording overhead
- `PositionBenchmark`: P&L calculations
- `QuoteBenchmark`: Quote processing

## Performance Metrics Captured

### Order Metrics
- Orders submitted/accepted/filled/cancelled/rejected counts
- Submit latency (order creation to network send)
- Ack latency (send to exchange acknowledgment)
- Fill latency (send to execution)
- Round-trip latency (complete order lifecycle)
- Throughput (orders per second)

### Latency Statistics
- Min, max, mean
- Percentiles: p50, p90, p95, p99, p99.9
- All values in nanoseconds
